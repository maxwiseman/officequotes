**Dwight:** Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR \[imitating trumpet\] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.   
**Ryan:** Are you holding this chair?   
**Dwight:** Yes.   
**Ryan:** √¢‚Ç¨Àúcause I feel like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna fall off.   
**Dwight:** Yes. Yes.   
**Ryan:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not wearing the right shoes for this.   
**Dwight:** We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.   
**Erin:** Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** Hey, my name√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Tabitha. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s working. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s already people camped out behind me. 
</Scene>

**Nellie:** Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m this patrician goddess. But here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, \[cockney accent\] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s lower than dirt?   
**Dwight:** Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.   
**Nellie:** Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even get a callback.   
**Jim:** Which Spice Girl?   
**Nellie:** The black one. I never stood a chance.   
**Jim:** Okay.   
**Nellie:** Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.   
**Dwight:** Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.   
**Todd Packer:** Yep   
**Dwight:** Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing √¢‚Ç¨“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna love √¢‚Ç¨Àúem. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?   
**Ryan:** When people see this presentation, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna \[bleep\] in their pants.   
**Dwight:** Okay.   
**Jim:** Come on, man.   
**Cathy:** Seriously disgusting.   
**Dwight:** Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.   
**Cathy:** Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.   
**Dwight:** Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Todd Packer:** Uh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
**Nellie:** Uh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ that is excellent.   
**Todd Packer:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t see what that gets us, but I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a team player.   
**Dwight:** Perfect casting, right?   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Todd Packer:** Schrute√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s out to get me. But I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Nellie:** I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.   
**Dwight:** Speaking of pimples, let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s release the BLOGGERS!   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Morning, everyone.   
**Kevin:** Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?   
**Andy:** Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t care. Tell me later.   
**Kevin:** Listen, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s important. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotta hear this.   
**Andy:** What do you got?   
**Kelly:** Oh, my god!   
**Phyllis:** Do you have a black eye?   
**Andy:** Yes, I do. Phyllis.   
**Kevin:** I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?   
**Andy:** What?   
**Kevin:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a kid on a bike. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a man in a car.   
**Darryl:** Andy, who punched you?   
**Meredith:** Hey, I was on the can. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this about a black guy in the office?   
**Angela:** Black eye, Meredith.   
**Kelly:** Will someone please explain what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like my life is buffering.   
**Andy:** Here√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
**Pam:** That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true.   
**Andy:** They had, uh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ weapons.   
**Pam:** Weapons.   
**Andy:** I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.   
**Pam:** But these were not the kind of people who use their words.   
**Andy:** Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.   
**Pam:** Thank goodness he was there.   
**Oscar:** Good job Andy.   
**Kevin:** Yeah \[all murmuring\]   
**Andy:** I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do anything any of you wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have done.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Open the gates! There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s plenty for everyone!   
**Man:** Quit it.   
**Dwight:** There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s plenty. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stampede. No need to stampede, sir.   
**Erin:** I was ahead of you!   
**Dwight:** Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna be fine. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna be fine. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s plenty of Pyramids.   
**Erin:** Come on. I was in line before you.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Cathy:** So you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a blogger right?   
**Blogger:** Yeah. Blogger.   
**Cathy:** God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to be a good girl for once.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want to leave yet. I haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t had so much fun since seeing√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Oscar:** How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!   
**Andy:** No.   
**Angela:** Yes.   
**Andy:** No, no, no, no, no, we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need to call the police. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s business, right, Pam?   
**Pam:** Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.   
**Andy:** And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.   
**Angela:** Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?   
**Andy:** Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5\.   
**Pam:** 1-8-5-0-5\.   
**Darryl:** Guys, guys. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7\.   
**Phyllis:** Look, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t feel safe. I think we should call the police.   
**Angela:** Yes.   
**Andy:** Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Toby is giving us self defense training.   
**Toby:** Me?   
**Andy:** Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?   
**Toby:** Yeah, um… I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll go put on my cup.   
**Andy:** Great.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Nellie:** Yes!   
**Blogger:** Okay.   
**Nellie:** I wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t really sure which one of you is Chuck.   
**Jim:** \[on phone\] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?   
**Blogger:** Look at that guy. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got his Sabre phone on, and he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not even using it.   
**Blogger 2:** This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.   
**Jim:** Uh, I – I gotta go. Okay.   
**Nellie:** Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.   
**Dwight:** Oh, no, no, no. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s good. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really — on the Internet, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a really — that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a really good, good, thing.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?   
**Jim:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m very sorry.   
**Nellie:** We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHello. Hi sweetie. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Jim. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù   
**Jim:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?   
**Dwight:** You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! √Ç¬ÝSurrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Point it towards the store, idiot! 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** \[laughs\] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is — damn it. Take over. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!   
**Erin:** We are closed! Come on.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Toby:** Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So… strike, scream, and run. All right? Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s try it.   
**Creed:** \[smacks Meredith√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s head\] \[screams\] \[runs out\]   
**Meredith:** Ow.   
**Toby:** That may have been my fault.   
**Meredith:** What the hell, Toby?   
**Toby:** Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIt√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all about the groin.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù   
**Andy:** What if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re being attacked by a √¢‚Ç¨¬¶ smallish man who happens to not have a groin?   
**Toby:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s very common.   
**Andy:** What if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re being attacked by a 4√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢11√¢‚Ç¨¬ù man who is penisless?   
**Oscar:** Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?   
**Andy:** Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.   
**Toby:** Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.   
**Andy:** So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?   
**Toby:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s interesting that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re drawn to the point of view of the attacker. √Ç¬ÝYou would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel… \[everyone groans\] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.   
**Angela:** Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.   
**Toby:** All right, well, let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t everyone stand? Okay, so… you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re being attacked. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.   
**Everyone:** One, two.   
**Andy:** \[softly\] Take that, kid.

**Dwight:** Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.   
**Lady Blogger:** Patty Grossman. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a woman.   
**Dwight:** But you still work for Wired, right?   
**Patty:** Yes.   
**Dwight:** Good! Okay. Flirt away.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Ryan:** Sabre. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time to come home.   
**Jim:** Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think …it seemed like you were a little nervous.   
**Ryan:** Yeah, no \[bleep\], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?   
**Dwight:** Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.   
**Ryan:** You know what?   
**Dwight:** You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.   
**Jim:** Dwight.   
**Dwight:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m trying to make him feel important.   
**Ryan:** God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.   
**Dwight:** Um… \[imitating Kelly\] Oh, Ryan, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so smart. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.   
**Ryan:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so ignorant. You barely know what you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.   
**Dwight:** What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a book? \[giggles\]   
**Ryan:** On my God. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so embarrassing. √Ç¬ÝMy mom would say the best stuff, though.   
**Jim:** \[ahem\] You can… \[slightly effeminate\] You can do it Ryan.   
**Ryan:** And you know that I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m capable of this.   
**Jim:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.   
**Ryan:** What did you think of the presentation?   
**Jim:** I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one —   
**Ryan:** Oh! √¢‚Ç¨≈ìFix√¢‚Ç¨¬ù means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!   
**Dwight:** Jim, get him a water.   
**Ryan:** No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!   
**Dwight:** Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Toby:** Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re alive.   
**Lady:** Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?   
**Andy:** \[deep voice\] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.   
**Girl:** That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s him… the guy I hit.   
**Darryl:** What?   
**Oscar:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotta be kidding me.   
**Kevin:** Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?   
**Oscar:** No, Kevin — \[sighs\]   
**Lady:** What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?   
**Girl:** There. That chubby one.   
**Pam:** I just had a baby.   
**Girl:** Yesterday?   
**Pam:** Wow.   
**Lady:** Apologize.   
**Girl:** Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthin√¢‚Ç¨¬ù girlfriend.   
**Pam:** How √¢‚Ç¨Àúbout we wait til next year after you have your kid?   
**Lady:** You know what? Tiffy√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going to college.   
**Andy:** \[deep voice\] Listen, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.   
**Lady:** God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.   
**Kevin:** Bye.   
**Kelly:** So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar — √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHow to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù   
**Toby:** There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.   
**Kelly:** No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.   
**Darryl:** Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.   
**Andy:** Oh… \[Kelly laughing\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Have you seen Erin?   
**Stanley:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m on break.   
**Dwight:** Oh God… √Ç¬ÝHey no! Where do you think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going? You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gotta stay for the big presentation we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve got this young wiz kid — Ryan. He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like an even more handsome Bill Gates.   
**Blogger:** When√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the presentation?   
**Dwight:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s moments away. Just stay here!   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Ryan:** \[on phone\] Hey Uncle Lucas, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s different because it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your wife? √Ç¬ÝWell, that doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t make any sense to me.   
**Nellie:** How you doing?   
**Ryan:** Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t talk to me right now. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry. I- I know you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t understand is… \[voice fades\]   
**Nellie:** \[to Dwight\] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** Sorry about kicking you out. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just, we don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t want our brand associated with death.   
**Old Lady:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s okay. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.   
**Erin:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not married yet?   
**Old Lady:** \[laughs\] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away.   
**Erin:** My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not really friends.   
**Old Lady:** Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!   
**Erin:** Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.   
**Old Lady:** Well…   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** How long has he been in the bathroom?   
**Jim:** About ten minutes.   
**Dwight:** Jeez! What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s he doing in there? \[cell phone vibrates\]   
**Jim:** Oops, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?   
**Dwight:** Are there any bloggers around?   
**Jim:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Ryan. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìI√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry. I lied. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not in the bathroom. I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do it. I need to see my mom. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m going home.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù   
**Nellie:** What is the delay here? Where√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Ryan? Why is he not here?   
**Dwight:** I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing… compared to this guy!   
**Jim:** Uh…   
**Nellie:** What?   
**Dwight:** That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s right. Will you just give us a second?   
**Nellie:** You are gonna bloody ruin it. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna bloody ruin it because you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re a no-good half-assed cock-eyed…   
**Jim:** okay.   
**Nellie:** That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s….   
**Dwight:** Jim —   
**Jim:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not doing the Presentation.   
**Dwight:** Look at me. Look at me! Look… at… this… face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m telling you… if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t do this, \[whispers\] I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t stand a chance. Please, Jim.   
**Jim:** Okay, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll do it.   
**Dwight:** Oh, my God. O… Kay! Go get into Ryan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s costume and check out his notes.   
**Jim:** A costume?   
**Dwight:** Of course there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a costume! \[laughs\] √Ç¬ÝOh, this is gonna be great. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?   
**Jim:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been in here for 20 seconds.   
**Dwight:** Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?   
**Jim:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not wearing eyeliner.   
**Dwight:** You are wearing eyeliner, Jim. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
 \[Coldplay√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Clocks\]   
**Jim:** Time. Space. Gender. \[Dwight mouthing words\] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that — the only thing that remain — the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time — love, values, and of course, the pyramids — the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. \[softly\] No, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s —   
**Dwight:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true.   
**Jim:** This… is the future, because… This is the past. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been through a lot of issues in my life. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen drug addiction — unemployment. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. \[scattered applause\]   
**Dwight:** Yep.   
**Jim:** When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. √Ç¬ÝI just wanted… to go home. √Ç¬ÝThis is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless… will be available in 2013\. √Ç¬ÝYou can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2\. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything — in time… and space.   
**Crowd:** ahhhhhh   
**Dwight:** Psst.   
**Jim:** Oh.   
**Ryan:** \[image on Pyramid\] Sabre… It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s time… to come home.   
**Crowd:** \[applause\]   
**Jim:** All right. √Ç¬ÝThank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! \[applause continues\]   
**Jim:** Yeah. √Ç¬ÝThank you. Thank you.

**Toby:** Okay, this isn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t over. Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s stay focused, okay? √Ç¬ÝWe made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but… little things can be dangerous.   
**Kevin:** Whether it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.   
**Toby:** Okay. Good point…   
**Angela:** Good point? What is a tub of electricity?   
**Toby:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t… I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t…   
**Oscar:** With all due respect we know what we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re defending against: a twelve year old female bully.   
**Kelly:** I was a twelve year old bully.   
**Angela:** Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.   
**Others:** Yeah.   
**Kelly:** Yeah, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.   
**Angela:** Thanks.   
**Kelly:** Good. Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s go.   
**Toby:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know if this is gonna help…Uh…   
**Angela:** Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s go Kelly.   
**Toby:** We should stay to maybe some more traditional models…   
**Kelly:** You think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re so pretty! √Ç¬ÝWell you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!   
**Toby:** Okay, this is what√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s called pre-violent posturing.   
**Kelly:** Take that! √Ç¬ÝNot so pre-violent anymore!
