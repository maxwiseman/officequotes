<Scene>
**Oscar:** Oh, for God├óŌé¼Ōäós sake. \[notices Erin planking on parking lot curb\] 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Oscar:** Planking is a very stupid and dangerous trend. Basically, you lie like a plank in weird places. That├óŌé¼Ōäós it. Sometimes you get run over. Welcome to the Internet. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** Planking is one of those things where, eh, you either get it or you don├óŌé¼Ōäót.├é┬Ā And I don├óŌé¼Ōäót.├é┬Ā But I am so excited to be a part of it. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** \[exiting elevator\] After you my good sir.   
**Dwight:** No, I insist.   
**Andy:** I insist.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California├óŌé¼┬” for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.├é┬Ā He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO… CEO… her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don├óŌé¼Ōäót really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.├é┬Ā├é┬Ā And he chose├óŌé¼┬” 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** \[drumroll with hands\] I├óŌé¼┬” it├óŌé¼Ōäós unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice├óŌé¼Ōäós first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, ├óŌé¼┼ōI need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.├óŌé¼┬Ø Smart, right?   
**Kelly:** (planking on top of cabinet\] Very smart.   
**Andy:** Uh, this has got to stop.   
**Kelly:** I can├óŌé¼Ōäót get down.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** K… Kevin! \[Kevin planking on Dwight├óŌé¼Ōäós desk\] 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I├óŌé¼Ōäóve got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I├óŌé¼Ōäóve added boxing – lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I├óŌé¼Ōäóm doin├óŌé¼Ōäó great. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** K, I├óŌé¼Ōäóm gonna need some help. Pam?   
**Pam:** I don├óŌé¼Ōäót think I should.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** Oh, yeah. Pregnant.   
**Pam:** Right here. Little Michael Scott- \[points to her belly\]   
**Jim:** No, I told you I don├óŌé¼Ōäót like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.   
**Pam:** Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Angela:** Look, it├óŌé¼Ōäós a ├óŌé¼╦£Little Pregs├óŌé¼Ōäó \[points to her belly\] and ├óŌé¼╦£Big Pregs├óŌé¼Ōäó \[points to Pam├óŌé¼Ōäós\]   
**Pam:** Wait, when did we start calling it that-   
**Angela:** Isn├óŌé¼Ōäót it amazing, the difference in our sizes?   
**Pam:** Well, I am a few months ahead of you.   
**Angela:** I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim… the great salesman.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Hoist him aloft. C├óŌé¼Ōäómon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. \[trying to lift Kevin off desk\]   
**Darryl:** I├óŌé¼Ōäóm lifting.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Darryl:** Yeah, I wanted the manager job, but I got somethin├óŌé¼Ōäó much better. This soda. This is mine. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Stanley:** It might be easier if you take a deep breath, lift from the knees, and shove it up your butt. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Stanley:** I came up with a new thing this summer. I act like I├óŌé¼Ōäóm telling someone how to do somethin├óŌé¼Ōäó. I go on with a long description and then I say, ├óŌé¼┼ōand shove it up your butt.├óŌé¼┬Ø It├óŌé¼Ōäós stupid, but it├óŌé¼Ōäós my thing now. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** No one should be planking at all.   
**Andy:** Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?   
**Dwight:** Say no more.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** \[starts attacking plankers\] Kids, don├óŌé¼Ōäót try planking. It├óŌé¼Ōäós dangerous. \[knocks Toby off table\] ├óŌé¼╦£Specially with me around. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** You watching that commercial again? \[Pam nods\] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it├óŌé¼Ōäós just gonna make you cry?   
**Pam:** Because everything makes me cry, so what├óŌé¼Ōäós the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.   
**Jim:** He├óŌé¼Ōäós got a bank vault. That├óŌé¼Ōäós a start.   
**Pam:** Not enough though.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he├óŌé¼Ōäós gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it├óŌé¼Ōäós not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It├óŌé¼Ōäós strange. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** Here we go.   
**Robert:** Hello.   
**Erin:** Robert California. Let├óŌé¼Ōäós have a conversation.   
**Robert:** Describe your day so far.   
**Erin:** Well, I woke up. And I hit the snooze-   
**Robert:** And when you recount your day, never say you woke up. It├óŌé¼Ōäós a waste of your time. That├óŌé¼Ōäós how every day├óŌé¼Ōäós begun, for everyone, since the dawn of man.   
**Erin:** Very smart, very smart. Suddenly, I was awake. And I├óŌé¼Ōäóve been doing this thing-   
**Andy:** Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don├óŌé¼Ōäót know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** Pam, pam. Psst. Pam. \[motions her over, both looking at Robert├óŌé¼Ōäós notebook\]   
**Pam:** Jim. \[motions him over\]   
**Jim:** \[motions he is on the phone\] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. \[comes over\] Okay. \[sees notebook with two lists of staff names\] What is this?   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?   
**Robert:** What are your thoughts.   
**Andy:** Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women├óŌé¼Ōäós soccer, no?   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** What are you looking at?   
**Jim:** It├óŌé¼Ōäós, it├óŌé¼Ōäós nothing.   
**Dwight:** It can├óŌé¼Ōäót be nothing.   
**Phyllis:** Yeah, it can├óŌé¼Ōäót be nothing.   
**Jim:**├é┬Ā It├óŌé¼Ōäós just a list of our names, split into two columns.   
**Stanley:** What?   
**Jim:** Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?   
**Erin:** No.   
**Jim:** No. Okay. Um, I├óŌé¼Ōäóll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?   
**Dwight:** \[throws hard, Jim doesn├óŌé¼Ōäót catch\] Nice catch.   
**Pam:** If he comes out, distract him. \[takes list to copier\]   
**Kevin:** We need a warning signal.   
**Jim:** We don├óŌé¼Ōäót need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-   
**Kevin:** We do.   
**Jim:** I promise you, we don├óŌé¼Ōäót need a warning-   
**Kevin:** WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!   
**Phyllis:** Ahhh! \[falls out of chair\]   
**Dwight:** Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?   
**Phyllis:** Yeah. Yeah. Oh.   
**Dwight:** ├óŌé¼┬” 2, 3! \[pulls Phyllis up\]   
**Phyllis:** Thanks guys.   
**Dwight:** Okay, which side of the list am I on?   
**Jim:** Left.   
**Dwight:** Yes!   
**Jim:** Why are you- How do you know?   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.   
**Jim:** Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert├óŌé¼Ōäós notebook.   
**Pam:** He left it at reception and we photocopied it.   
**Andy:** Oh, okay. I don├óŌé¼Ōäót want any part of this.   
**Pam:** Maybe it├óŌé¼Ōäós a list of people he├óŌé¼Ōäós gonna fire.   
**Jim:** Okay, it├óŌé¼Ōäós not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here├óŌé¼Ōäós something. Who would eat who in an ├óŌé¼╦£Alive├óŌé¼Ōäó situation. No… that can├óŌé¼Ōäót be it.   
**Andy:** I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side├óŌé¼Ōäós the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.   
**Jim:** I don├óŌé¼Ōäót think it├óŌé¼Ōäós-   
**Pam:** ├óŌé¼╦£Scuse me?   
**Dwight:** Shhh, Pam. C├óŌé¼Ōäómon, don├óŌé¼Ōäót be such a right-sider.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Angela:** Did you guys figure it out?   
**Andy:** We couldn├óŌé¼Ōäót crack it.   
**Stanley:** Go in there and just ask the man what it means.   
**Andy:** He├óŌé¼Ōäóll know that we looked at his private notebook.   
**Phyllis:** C├óŌé¼Ōäómon, just say you saw the list by accident.   
**Andy:** I├óŌé¼Ōäóm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it├óŌé¼Ōäós starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.   
**Phyllis:** Yeah, that├óŌé¼Ōäós all you had to do today was ask about Columbus Day?   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Robert:** \[Andy continuously knocking on door\] Yes, for god├óŌé¼Ōäós sake Andy. Yes, come in.   
**Andy:** What├óŌé¼Ōäós up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.   
**Robert:** Great. Thank you.   
**Andy:** And it was open. And people saw this. And they├óŌé¼Ōäóre just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.   
**Robert:** What is this?   
**Andy:** It├óŌé¼Ōäós a photocopy from your notebook.   
**Robert:** You read my notebook? And photocopied it. And distributed it.   
**Andy:** No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.   
**Robert:** Ah, please. Here├óŌé¼Ōäós what it is. It├óŌé¼Ōäós a doodle.   
**Andy:** What?   
**Robert:** Some people doodle at work when they let their mind run. They draw houses, penises. Funny how the houses are always colonials and the penises are always circumcised. Don├óŌé¼Ōäót you think? Well, I doodle too, but I├óŌé¼Ōäóm not an artist. So I draw words and lists.   
**Andy:** That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?   
**Robert:** Might as well have been sketching a cube.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Okay. Robert├óŌé¼Ōäós in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?   
**Meredith:** Maybe we├óŌé¼Ōäóre s├óŌé¼Ōäóposed to do it with people in our group.   
**Jim:** That├óŌé¼Ōäós not it.   
**Meredith:** People in the other group.   
**Jim:** Mmum, still wrong.   
**Andy:** Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?   
**Stanley:** Well, you take the first letter from each name, assign it a number, add ├óŌé¼╦£em all up, and SHOVE IT UP YOUR BUTT!   
**Andy:** Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.   
**Kevin:** I know! It├óŌé¼Ōäós alphabetical.   
**Everyone:** \[separately\] No.   
**Dwight:** No, it├óŌé¼Ōäós not. Here├óŌé¼Ōäós how we find out. Let├óŌé¼Ōäós line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let├óŌé¼Ōäós just size each other up here and left side of the list├óŌé¼┬” ATTACK!   
**Jim:** Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! \[Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling\]   
**Andy:** Dwight!   
**Meredith:** Hey!   
**Kevin:** Warning! Warning! Warning!   
**Robert:** \[enters room, everyone quiets and separates\] I├óŌé¼Ōäód like to invite the following people to join me for lunch: Jim, Dwight, Angela, Darryl, Kevin, Toby, Phyllis, Oscar.   
**Dwight:** That├óŌé¼Ōäós great. Let├óŌé¼Ōäós do this guys.   
**Jim:** Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.   
**Pam:** I love you so much. \[starting to cry\]   
**Jim:** Hey. It├óŌé¼Ōäós nothing. Alright? I├óŌé¼Ōäóll text you when we get there. Let you know what├óŌé¼Ōäós going on.   
**Pam:** Okay. \[turns to computer\]   
**Jim:** Nope. No dog video.   
**Pam:** Okay.   
**Jim:** Okay. See you guys.   
**Andy:** Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Robert:** Jim, your daughter, Cecilia. What does she think of the street?   
**Jim:** Uhhh, the street?   
**Robert:** Sesame street.   
**Jim:** Oh, I didn├óŌé¼Ōäót know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.   
**Robert:** Elmo, god├óŌé¼Ōäós sake, it├óŌé¼Ōäós the Elmo era.   
**Jim:** Right.   
**Robert:** Sesame Street was created to reflect the environment of the children watching it. Complete self-absorption of Elmo is brilliantly reflective of our time. Ours is a cultural ghetto. Wouldn├óŌé¼Ōäót you agree.   
**Jim:** Yeah, she does like Elmo.   
**Oscar:** Cultural ghetto? Totally- totally agree.   
**Phyllis:** Completely.   
**Darryl:** Apt. Apt analysis, Robert.   
**Kevin:** The thing that I like about Elmo is the tickling.   
**Toby:** I should not be here. I├óŌé¼Ōäóm in the- I was in the wrong- I├óŌé¼Ōäóm- I├óŌé¼Ōäóm sorry. Uh, just picture me back there. I- I was never here.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Great group! Pizza party!   
**Kelly:** How is this a pizza party?   
**Andy:** Well, why don├óŌé¼Ōäót you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.   
**Kelly:** Yeah, well, that├óŌé¼Ōäós just pizza. You need at least one other element for it to be a party.   
**Andy:** Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?   
**Stanley:** What├óŌé¼Ōäós that?   
**Andy:** Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.   
**Stanley:** That├óŌé¼Ōäós pizza.   
**Pam:** That├óŌé¼Ōäós regular pizza.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question… what made you pick this group?   
**Robert:** I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.   
**Dwight:** Okay!   
**Everyone:** \[separately\] Awww.   
**Phyllis:** Well, what about the other guys.   
**Dwight:** Losers.   
**Robert:** No.   
**Dwight:** C├óŌé¼Ōäómon.   
**Robert:** I don├óŌé¼Ōäót- I don├óŌé¼Ōäót wanna say-   
**Dwight:** C├óŌé¼Ōäómon, c├óŌé¼Ōäómon.   
**Robert:** No, no.   
**Dwight:** C├óŌé¼Ōäómon.   
**Robert:** Ha, I guess I think they├óŌé¼Ōäóre losers.   
**Dwight:** Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!   
**Robert:** Probably shouldn├óŌé¼Ōäót have said that. \[Jim├óŌé¼Ōäós jaw drops\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.   
**Pam:** \[Pam├óŌé¼Ōäós phone vibrates\] Oh, text from Jim. ├óŌé¼┼ōThis is getting very weird. Will explain later.├óŌé¼┬Ø   
**Pam:** \[Everyone├óŌé¼Ōäós phone vibrates\] Oh, text from Kevin.   
**Meredith:** ├óŌé¼┼ōSuck it losers.├óŌé¼┬Ø   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Ryan:** Okay, not to point out the glaringly obvious, but doesn├óŌé¼Ōäót the fact that I├óŌé¼Ōäóm in this group make anyone feel just a little bit better? Oh! This crust is sharp!   
**Pam:** I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, ├óŌé¼┼ōWho├óŌé¼Ōäós that receptionist? I like her.├óŌé¼┬Ø Now I├óŌé¼Ōäóm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you├óŌé¼Ōäóre like, ├óŌé¼┼ōOh, loser.├óŌé¼┬Ø   
**Andy:** C├óŌé¼Ōäómon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?   
**Pam:** Oh. Oh God.   
**Kelly:** \[door opens, others enter\] Oh. Hey guys! We had so much fun. We had Margarita pizza. We all hung out. Got to know each other better. How was your lunch?   
**Angela:** It was excellent.   
**Darryl:** Good times.   
**Andy:** Yeah?   
**Dwight:** Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it├óŌé¼Ōäós over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Kevin:** I knew it. I just knew, my whole life, that everyone was wrong about me. My parents, my teachers, my friends, the doctors. Everyone. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?   
**Pam:** Yeah, I├óŌé¼Ōäóm fine.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Kevin:** \[spraying Meredith and Creed with water gun\] Loser. Losers. \[Dwight holding up ├óŌé¼┼ōL├óŌé¼┬Ø to his forehead\]   
**Meredith:** \[on the phone, while getting sprayed\] Just take the casserole out of the- Take it out of the refrigerator and put it in the oven. It├óŌé¼Ōäóll be fine, just leave it in for 20 minutes.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** When I was a salesman I could just be like ├óŌé¼┼ōNot my job, not my prob. I├óŌé¼Ōäóm going to the warehouse to polish my knob.├óŌé¼┬Ø Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it├óŌé¼Ōäós really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let├óŌé¼Ōäós say top-tier and others would be second-tier.   
**Robert:** I never said that.   
**Andy:** Thank you. Great. Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you├óŌé¼Ōäóre talking about?   
**Andy:** Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I├óŌé¼Ōäóm thinking of. Can you clarify that?   
**Robert:** Let me tell you some things I find productive. Positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement. Honesty. I├óŌé¼Ōäóll tell you some things I find unproductive. Constantly worrying about where you stand based on inscrutable social clues. And then, inevitably reframing it all in a reassuring way so that you can get to sleep at night. No, I do not believe in that at all. If I invited you to lunch, I think you├óŌé¼Ōäóre a winner. If I didn├óŌé¼Ōäót, I don├óŌé¼Ōäót. But I just met you all. Life is long, opinions change. Winners prove me right. Losers, prove me wrong.   
**Phyllis:** Whew, well. I guess that├óŌé¼Ōäós that.   
**Andy:** No. No, no.   
**Erin:** Andy, don├óŌé¼Ōäót go in there!   
**Andy:** I├óŌé¼Ōäóm going in there.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don├óŌé¼Ōäót know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I├óŌé¼Ōäóm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.   
**Robert:** I├óŌé¼Ōäóm not gonna change my list, Andy, and I don├óŌé¼Ōäót use ballpoint pens.   
**Andy:** Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley… you may think he├óŌé¼Ōäós a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he├óŌé¼Ōäós hard to love, but did you know that he├óŌé¼Ōäós in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?   
**Robert:** I did not know about the sales figures.   
**Andy:** Meredith Palmer… Supplier relations. The word ├óŌé¼┼ōno├óŌé¼┬Ø not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I├óŌé¼Ōäóm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.   
**Dwight:** Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.   
**Jim:** Shhh.   
**Andy:** Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Erin:** I like my new group. I liked my old group. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Robert:** Are we done?   
**Andy:** Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we├óŌé¼Ōäóre gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.   
**Robert:** You want a three and half day weekend for Columbus Day?   
**Andy:** Yes, I do.   
**Robert:** And you are aware that Columbus and his legions committed genocide against an entire civilization of Native Americans.   
**Andy:** I don├óŌé¼Ōäót care. \[Robert smiles as Andy exits\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.   
**Stanley:** We get that every year.   
**Andy:** Well, you got it this year too.   
**Phyllis:** Good night, Andy.   
**Andy:** Night.   
**Angela:** Bye.   
**Oscar:** Good night Andy.   
**Dwight:** Good night.   
**Andy:** Night.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** Alright, I├óŌé¼Ōäóm gonna go warm up the car.   
**Pam:** Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Pam:** Okay, I know I├óŌé¼Ōäóve been crying easily today, but- \[shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, ├óŌé¼┼ōPam├óŌé¼┬Ø and ├óŌé¼┼ōCece├óŌé¼┬Ø on one side, ├óŌé¼┼ōEverything else├óŌé¼┬Ø on the other\] I mean, that├óŌé¼Ōäós just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it├óŌé¼Ōäós stupid. No. \[starts crying\] It├óŌé¼Ōäós wonderful. I├óŌé¼Ōäóm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** I gotta say, I think it’s kinda cool not knowing. It’s like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It’s kinda sophisticated.   
**Kelly:** Everybody hates those endings!   
**Pam:** \[weepy\] Yeah, I hate those endings.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Oscar:** I- \[Sees Kevin looking at the list upside down and turns it.\]   
**Kevin:** I was looking for patterns.   
**Oscar:** I know.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Ryan:** It’s all a mind game. He wanted us to see the list. He’s a genius. You guys just don’t get him.   
**Creed:** I made a list like this for Congress when I worked in Hollywood in the 50’s, they’re meaningless.   
**Toby:** Guys. Really, it’s ok. Everyone has made a really solid first impression, I don’t think there’s any reason for anybody to worry. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Toby:** I am on the wrong side, and I am freaking out here. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** \[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk\] Man, it’s like hoisting a manatee. I can’t get a grip it’s so vast.   
**Jim:** Ryan? A little help?   
**Dwight:** God. How do whalers do it?
