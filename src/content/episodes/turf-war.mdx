<Scene>
**Gabe:** Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.   
**Dwight:** Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you just take estrogen? \[swallows powder\] \[coughs\] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? \[kisses bicep\] Mwah.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Gabe:** I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d flex them all night at the discotheque.   
**Dwight:** Oh, I bet you think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all about core, huh?   
**Gabe:** Yeah.   
**Dwight:** Oh, please.   
**Gabe:** Core√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One √¢‚Ç¨“ lengthen. Two √¢‚Ç¨“ elongate.   
**Jim:** Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the strongest? Well, there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s only one way to solve that √¢‚Ç¨“ flat curl contest.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.   
**Dwight:** Feast on this, Lewis.   
**Gabe:** I love the burn. The burn is where I live.   
**Jim:** Come on, Gabe, you can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t handle his hamstrings. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re getting hypno-thigh-zed.   
**Gabe:** Speed set. One. Two.   
**Jim:** Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.   
**Dwight:** Oh, thank you.   
**Jim:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re welcome.   
**Gabe:** Five. Six.   
**Jim:** Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,   
**All:** Eight, nine, ten.   
**Gabe:** We got it?   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Very funny Jim.   
**Gabe:** Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.   
**Robert:** Everyone, conference room, now. \[Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over\]   
**Jim:** All right, easy there, grandpa.   
**Dwight:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need your help.   
**Jim:** Okay. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t need my help?   
**Dwight:** Here, here√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Just√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Morning.   
**Erin:** Hey.   
**Andy:** Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ these.   
**Erin:** Oh.   
**Andy:** You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.   
**Erin:** Andy, if you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna hang out for a while, uh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
**Andy:** What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s this?   
**Erin:** This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.   
**Andy:** Is this Robert√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s attempt to embarrass me?   
**Erin:** No, of course not. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just √¢‚Ç¨“ I think it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like, where does it end? So just√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ \[puts visitors tag on Andy\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a little much? √¢‚Ç¨¬¶Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what it feels like. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.   
**Dwight:** Good, we have a deal?   
**Jim:** Thanks Janet.   
**Dwight:** Thanks so much Earl.   
**Jim:** Wow, simultaneous sale.   
**Dwight:** And they said it couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be done. Boom!   
**Jim:** Screw √¢‚Ç¨Àúem.   
**Andy:** Lot going on guys. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s happening?   
**Jim:** Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.   
**Andy:** That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like a festival of poo.   
**Jim:** Hey, hey, come on, language.   
**Dwight:** Yeah, and we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.   
**Jim:** In the fridge.   
**Dwight:** No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.   
**Jim:** Sorry, man, I can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t focus on zingers. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s too many potential clients.   
**Stanley:** You two better watch yourselves.   
**Phyllis:** Yeah, the Syracuse branch can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be happy you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re taking New York clients.   
**Robert:** Shh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ shh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ \[vomits in trash can\]   
**Jim:** Robert?   
**Oscar:** Why did Binghamton close?   
**Robert:** Can everyone just, please√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and √¢‚Ç¨“ how should I say this √¢‚Ç¨“ Columbian whites. What √¢‚Ç¨“ what is this about, uh, Binghamton?   
**Kevin:** The branch closed. Forever.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Robert:** Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Nellie:** I got your voicemail. From √¢‚Ç¨“ from last night.   
**Robert:** Wonderful.   
**Nellie:** And the answer√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. \[leaves\]   
**Robert:** Pam, when√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t hold the memories in?   
**Pam:** Oh, it was this summer √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Robert:** Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.   
**Pam:** Um, I am a little busy.   
**Robert:** Yes, √¢‚Ç¨Àúcourse. Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.   
**Pam:** Yeah, I can make you a list.   
**Robert:** Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s do it now. What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s number one?   
**Pam:** Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I help you now?   
**Robert:** There we go.   
**Pam:** Okay.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
 \[Andy cooking food by reception, Harry walks in\]   
**Harry:** Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?   
**Erin:** Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?   
**Dwight:** And you are√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
**Harry:** Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.   
\[shocked look from Jim\]   
**Harry:** What the hell√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s all this?   
**Andy:** Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.   
**Harry:** You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s that guy?   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Jim:** The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.   
**Dwight:** Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to √¢‚Ç¨“ how do I put this √¢‚Ç¨“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.   
**Jim:** Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.   
**Dwight:** Yes.   
**Jim:** Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. \[shows sketch\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** \[pointing at Toby\] There he is. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Lloyd.   
**Toby:** Me?   
**Creed:** Yeah, you.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Harry:** Where do you get off crossing state lines?   
**Toby:** Now, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Toby:** I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t back down from anybody. And he calls people √¢‚Ç¨≈ìKimosabe√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Harry:** They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re New York. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re New York. State line is the dividing line. That’s the way it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s always been.   
**Jim:** There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s actually not a rule that says that.   
**Dwight:** That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true.   
**Toby:** That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s true. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no rule. You can check the employee handbook.   
**Harry:** Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?   
**Toby:** No.   
**Dwight:** Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve choked so many people by now.   
**Harry:** Stay out of my state. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s in your best interest to stay out of my state.   
**Toby:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.   
**Harry:** Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.   
**Toby:** Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. \[runs outside\]   
**Jim:** How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?   
**Harry:** Robert√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think we were doing that.   
**Dwight:** Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s leg.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Robert:** Where√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s the Advil, Jim? I think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve hit my limit on the Tylenol √¢‚Ç¨“ Oh.   
**Andy:** \[Doing dishes\] Sorry, not Jim.   
**Robert:** Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?   
**Andy:** Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.   
**Robert:** Oh, for god √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Harry:** Robert California. What a surprise you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re here in Scranton.   
**Robert:** Harry√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
**Harry:** So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?   
**Robert:** How do you mean?   
**Andy:** I forgot, a√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ a pan, uh √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Harry:** No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.   
**Robert:** Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ so poorly timed.   
**Dwight:** Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.   
**Harry:** Listen, Robert, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have time. There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Dwight:** Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t listen to him.   
**Harry:** Used to be Binghamton√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Dwight:** Nope.   
**Harry:** I want it, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mine.   
**Dwight:** Prestige is ours. Okay, they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.   
**Harry:** We need you to make a decision.   
**Dwight:** Make a decision.   
**Robert:** I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ \[Andy walks out\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. \[walking to car\] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Robert:** Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? \[camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room\] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Harry:** Is it just me or is our boss a freakin√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ weirdo? \[stands up, walks outside\] I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna get some air.   
**Dwight:** Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.   
**Jim:** \[Gets up and looks out Nellie√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s office window\] He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s running!   
**Dwight:** Damn it!   
**Jim:** Damn it.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Wha √¢‚Ç¨“ what is this supposed to be?   
**Jim:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a monkey.   
**Dwight:** Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.   
**Jim:** Hold on, hold on. Is this him?   
**Dwight:** What?   
**Jim:** Is that him?   
**Dwight:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s him! Do something! Get out!   
**Jim:** What? What am I gonna do? I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Dwight:** Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. \[Jim opens passenger door\] That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s it? Oh, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s great. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s like a five second delay.   
**Jim:** Dwight!   
**Dwight:** Come on, let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.   
**Jim:** Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?   
**Dwight:** Yeah.   
**Jim:** Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.   
**Dwight:** Hit the nos.   
**Jim:** Are you sure?   
**Dwight:** Yes.   
**Jim:** Brace yourself. 3√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ 2√¢‚Ç¨¬¶   
**Dwight:** Got it. Go.   
**Jim:** 1\. Here we go! \[turns on wipers\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.   
**Receptionist:** Oh, do you have an appointment?   
**Andy:** No, I do not.   
**Receptionist:** Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.   
**Andy:** Seriously? √¢‚Ç¨ÀúCause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.   
**Receptionist:** He√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s really not that busy.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Is there someone here to see me?   
**Receptionist:** Yes, this man.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Come on in. \[Andy walks in\]   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Pam:** So√¢‚Ç¨¬¶what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?   
**Nellie:** Oh. Oh, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll tell you what he does.   
**Angela:**: \[walks in\] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worry, I won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t lay an egg.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Angela:**: Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? \[laughs\] 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Angela:**: I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.   
**Gabe:** Did someone say girl talk?   
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Gabe:** Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Gabe:** Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.   
**Nellie:** Do you think I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?   
**Gabe:** Uh, I think you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. \[chuckles\] It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be upsetting if you don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t.   
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Why haven√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t I heard of you? You got any references?   
**Andy:** No. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m a rogue.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Uh-huh.   
**Andy:** Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ \[pulls out business card\] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Every salesman I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.   
**Andy:** Of course they have. Which is why I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m giving you a key to my house. \[gives key to C.E.O\] Whatever you need √¢‚Ç¨“ anytime, night or day √¢‚Ç¨“ you just stop on by.   
**Mr. Ramish:** You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.   
**Andy:** Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. \[takes off belt, ties doors together\]   
**Dwight:** \[Running\] Ahhh! \[Slides into elevator\]   
**Jim:** You all right?   
**Dwight:** Yeah. \[Doors about to close, hand stops them\] Oh.   
**Jim:** Ah! \[Harry walks in\]   
**Jim:** \[Dwight pushes button for floor two\] Dwight, what are you doing?   
**Dwight:** Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!   
**Jim:** What are you talking about?   
**Dwight:** Just run! Take the stairs!   
**Jim:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know where the stairs are!   
**Dwight:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll stall him. Go!   
**Jim:** God!   
**Harry:** \[Dwight jumping\] What are you doing?   
**Dwight:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be stuck between floors for hours. \[pants fall down\] Oh. \[Jim runs in\] My pants fell down.   
**Jim:** What?   
**Dwight:** My pants fell down! I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have a belt!   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Dwight:** \[walks into lobby\] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.   
**Mr. Ramish:** What√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s going on?   
**Dwight:** Well √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Harry:** Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Dwight:** I was here first.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.   
**Dwight:** I already made an appointment√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ with your secretary.   
**Mr. Ramish:** Let me stop you all right here. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve already picked a new paper supplier.   
**Dwight:** Wait, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not D.M Utica, is it?   
**Mr. Ramish:** No, no, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Big Red Paper Company.   
**Jim:** Big Red Paper Company?   
**Mr. Ramish:** Mm-hmm.   
  
  
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Andy:** Yes, yes, yes! 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Harry:** Give me a cup of coffee.   
**Dwight:** Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?   
**Jim:** All right, guys. It didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t work out for any of us, so√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re still on the same team. Let me get these.   
**Dwight:** No. Let him get his own. It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Syracuse money.   
**Harry:** You know, your partner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?   
**Dwight:** Jim couldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t land me in a thousand years.   
**Jim:** But you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re saying there√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a chance.   
**Dwight:** Shut up. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Pam:** \[Walks into conference room\] Hey.   
**Robert:** Hmm.   
**Pam:** I stole Nellie√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s phone.   
**Robert:** Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.   
**Pam:** What do you want from me?   
**Robert:** Now we get to the bottom of Nellie√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s √¢‚Ç¨≈ìyes, yes, yes, yes, never.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù   
**Phone:** Hi, Nell, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be as bad as you described.   
**Robert:** Oh yes it can.   
**Phone:** This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.   
**Robert:** Shopaholic.   
**Pam:** Sounds like it.   
**Robert:** Yeah.   
**Phone:** Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?   
**Robert:** Ah.   
**Phone:** This is Annie from second nests. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna hold out for that.   
**Pam:** Okay, that√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s enough. \[grabs phone\]   
**Robert:** Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.   
**Pam:** No, no, no!   
**Robert:** No, come on.   
**Pam:** Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re all deleted.   
**Robert:** Pam, Pam, you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve completely bungled this!   
**Pam:** Ah. Ahh. \[walks out\] 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Pam:** Hey.   
**Nellie:** Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?   
**Pam:** Um√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ yes. Definitely. With your hair √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Nellie:** Oh!   
**Pam:** Certainly. Um√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ you dropped your cell phone.   
**Nellie:** Oh, gosh.   
**Pam:** Yep.   
**Nellie:** Thank you. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ so stupid.   
**Pam:** No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.   
**Nellie:** Oh, god, Pam. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get me started.   
**Pam:** No, I will not.   
**Nellie:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve just got me started. Robert√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ is√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ a filthy beast. I mean, don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you get the feeling, he√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?   
**Pam:** Well √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Nellie:** I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.   
**Pam:** But sometimes he talks about flesh√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ and bacchanals.   
**Nellie:** I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.   
**Pam:** No√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t. Just put it out of your mind.   
**Nellie:** Pam, what is your address? I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t √¢‚Ç¨“   
**Nellie:** Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper. 
</Scene>
<Scene>
**Nellie:** Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ I have a new friend. A friend. At work.

**Robert:** \[Erin opens door\] Erin.   
**Erin:** There√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a call for you on line one.   
**Robert:** Who is it?   
**Erin:** He says salvation. No last name.   
**Robert:** Yeah, hello?   
**Andy:** \[in car\] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t, and I will find another buyer.   
**Robert:** You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re blackmailing me.   
**Andy:** It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s just business.   
**Robert:** Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even know my real name. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m the \*bleep\* lizard king. \[disconnects\]   
**Andy:** Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. \[gets out of car, walks to house\]   
**David:** \[opens door\] Andy Bernard.   
**Andy:** You got a minute?   
**David:** Um√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the middle of a piano lesson.   
**Andy:** I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.   
**David:** Dunder Mifflin. \[closes door\] Now√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ why would I want that? It√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s worth half of what it was three years ago.   
**Andy:** Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.   
**David:** Why don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t you come in? \[Andy walks in, closes door\]

**Harry:** So what would you do if you weren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t selling paper?   
**Jim:** Oh, man, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.   
**Dwight:** What?   
**Jim:** Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.   
**Dwight:** How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t even care about nationals.   
**Harry:** Nothing?   
**Jim:** I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t know. I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?   
**Harry:** I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ a plane. One sale, I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m out.   
**Jim:** That sounds lovely.   
**Harry:** Anyway, Robert√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s gonna run this company into the ground, so√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ We won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be doing this in six months.
